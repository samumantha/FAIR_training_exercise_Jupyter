Jupyter is a versatile tool for executable notebooks available on multiple platforms from own computer to the cloud. The lesson will introduce the tool as an alternative to writing scripts and discuss the usecases for scripts versus notebooks.\nEligibility for participation: Open for everyone, but most useful for researchers who code\nTime and date: 22.10 at XX.XX\nExpectations: Everyone can follow the lesson\nGrading: No grading"
